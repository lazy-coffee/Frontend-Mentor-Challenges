## My process

-Drawing out the project on paper and determining the vertical and horizontal grids
-Creating the project layout and using different colors to differentiate each div. This makes it easier for me to adjust proportions
-Adding the html text, image and background colors
-Editing the text to match the reference provided

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

How to center a div using grid.

```css
/* Code to center a div*/
.white-background{
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    padding: 17px;
}
```

### Continued development

Making the project reponsive with flexbox mechanisms
