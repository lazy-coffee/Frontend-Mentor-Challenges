## My process
- I made a sketch of the webpage first. I do this so 
  can properly layout sections of the webpage and outline the divs
- I created all elements of the webpage layout and   adjusted their proportions
- I added the transition properties to the title

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development
I plan to improve the webpage by making it responsive in the future
